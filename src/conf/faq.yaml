  question: Who is this site for?
  answer: |
    This page is targeted to Synology's NAS device users. In short: Synology provides possibility to 
    add third-party package source to their Package Center. There are many servers that provides 
    additional packages to Synology's system, however they are distributed and links can be found
    mostly on community forums. We collect server URL's in one place and provides to you search engine, 
    so you can easily find the package you look for. When you want to add it to your device, 
    you just need to add source to your system and install the package from it.

  name: HowItWorks
  question: How the search works?
  answer: |
    The website is pretending to be a Synology device and querying known third-party package servers 
    for the list of all packages to specific architecture, DSM version etc. 
    The result (in JSON format) is analysed and we filter out packages that does not meet requirements given by the user 
    (i.e. keyword). The keyword is searched in package name and description.

  name: SourceUnsupported
  question: Why source http://xyz.com is in unsupported section?
  answer: |
    There could be many reasons. Each package server has it's own implementation and may work differently.
    Synology's Package Center is handling with them well due to good error correction (such as ignoring invalid 
    characters, ignoring additional content, etc.). We are verifying new sources and when, for some reason, 
    it does not work, then we put it into unsupported section. We are trying to solve the problem on our side, 
    however sometimes it is not possible or it is time consuming. We also try to contact with the server owner
    and asking them for help.

  name: WorkingSlow
  question: Why search is working slow sometimes?
  answer: |
    It might work slow for the first query. The website is querying servers for the packages one after another 
    and this may take a while. However, due to caching results, next searches should work much faster. 
    Cache is expiring after 24h, so after that time website will query servers once again. We are still working 
    on the performance. Hopefully it will work better soon.
